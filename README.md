FIXME: Description

### Abstract
Portable OSS device with long battery life and enough processiong power for power-demanding events

#### Open-source
This device does not expect proprietary globs.

Schematics, 3D Design for casing, Firmware, etc.. has to be open-source to public

#### Weight
2 (+- 2) kg weight

#### Long battery life
assuming software or hardware method is used to restrict the power needed to achieve such battery life with use-case for applications that are not power-demanding i.e SSH, IRC, Internet browser, etc.. 

#### Sufficient processing power for power-demanding events

Power-demanding events being compilation, rendering of audio-visual content, IA experiments, Gaming, etc..

Assuming that used battery doesn't have sufficient capacity to last long enough to be reliably used for defined usecase then expecting an option to plug the device to the power source and for it to switch mode that would allow this runtime without restrictions

#### Water and dust proofing
The more water and dust resistent this is the better

#### Docking station
Docking station used to get envrionment at home for keyboard, mouse, monitor, ethernet, etc.. without the need to plug these directly to the device (ideally without these ports being present on the device for water and dust proofing)

#### Access to the bateries
Bateries should be removable from the device without the need to disassemble it

If possible this shoudn't affect the water and dust proofing

#### Sensoring
expecting sensors to monitor the health of the device

more sensors the better

#### Rugged
Should be resistant to impact, scratches, etc..
